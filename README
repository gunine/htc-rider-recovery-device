This repository contains the device setting files for building the custom recovery from source.
The supported devices are, now, restricted for hTC rider(Evo 4G+) only.
8x60-recovery folder contains the necessary files for supporting charging (hTC proprietary...).
Currently, the ClockWorkMod(CWM) and Team Win Recovery Project(TWRP) have been tested!
Other custom recoveries also are possiblely built by using this source.
Test it and let me know. :)
